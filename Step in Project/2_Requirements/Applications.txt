Visual studio Code
          -> To design and run the code. In this we will be creating many different files with the specific function, 
              which we can be used in the another file of the same project.
              And finallywe will be merging all these with the make file to execute our project.

CPPCHECK
          -> This application will be useful for the finding errors in a clear and simple way.
             For suppose if we have a error in one file of the the project.
             In the VS code we cant find the exat error.
             Whereas the CPPcheck will show the exat error and we can be able to rectify it.

DOXYWIZARD
          -> In this application we can create a documentation for the project with the required  matter and efficient data.

DRMEMORY
          -> This application is used to create the memory for our project in the laptop or PC.
             Many of the projects required the memory allocation proces. 
             For that purpose we need this application.
GIT BASH 
          -> If we need to share our projects with our partner or some other employee.
             we need to upload the project in the GITHUB.
             To upload the project in the GITHUB we are going to use this GIT BASH application.
             There will be some commands that are to be entered in the gitbash to upload the project to the GitHUB
